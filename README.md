[00:14.00] Typa girl that'll make you wanna dream (me)
[00:18.20] Typa girl that came straight off of the screen (screen, screen)
[00:21.80] Typa girl you wanna ice up, make me freeze (hot, hot)
[00:25.50] Typa girl you wanna wife up, sign the pre
[00:28.30] I bring money to the table, not your dinner
[00:31.90] Both my body and my bank account, good figure
[00:35.60] Thinkin' 'bout me, but there's nothing to consider
[00:39.10] If I let you in my circle, you a winner
[00:43.60] Didn't know that you were cold 'til you felt my fire
[00:47.40] Heaven's gate just opened up, hearing choirs
[00:51.00] If you say something else, you a liar
[00:56.60] 'Cause I'm that girl that drive you crazy, but you can't leave me alone
[01:01.60] Got you thinkin' maybe I went supernatural
[01:05.10] Put you under spells or look into a crystal ball
[01:08.80] I'm not like these other girls at all
[01:12.40] I'm the typa girl that make you forget that you got a type
[01:16.00] Type that make you love me when the only thing you done is like
[01:19.80] I'm that typa girl, I'm that typa girl
[01:23.37] I'm that typa girl, I'm that typa girl
[01:26.30] Like du-du-dun, du-du-du-dun
[01:30.00] Like du-du-dun, du-du-du-dun
[01:33.02] Uh, I'm the type of girl that everybody type
[01:35.90] Double tap, tap, tap, what everybody like
[01:37.83] You can check my stats, got everybody's eye
[01:39.62] And I run them laps 'round everybody's mind
[01:41.50] All of these girls on some uppercase shit
[01:43.40] That mean they all cap
[01:45.30] Being the best at whatever I do
[01:47.10] That's sounding on brand
[01:48.30] Typa girl that you wish for when you blow that candle out
[01:52.00] Typa girl that you wanna take back to your mama house
[01:55.80] Typa girl that don't ask for what she wants, she's takin' out
[01:59.40] Typa girl who got bag in same quality as Chanel
[02:03.81] Now you know that you were cold 'cause you felt my fire
[02:07.40] Heaven's gate just opened up, hearing choirs
[02:11.07] If you say something else, you a liar
[02:16.60] 'Cause I'm that girl that drive you crazy, but you can't leave me alone
[02:21.50] Got you thinkin' maybe I went supernatural
[02:25.10] Put you under spells or look into a crystal ball
[02:28.70] I'm not like these other girls at all
[02:32.50] I'm the typa girl that make you forget that you got a type
[02:36.00] Type that make you love me when the only thing you done is like
[02:39.85] I'm that typa girl, I'm that typa girl
[02:43.31] I'm that typa girl, I'm that typa girl
[02:46.30] Like du-du-dun, du-du-du-dun
[02:49.90] Like du-du-dun, du-du-du-dun
